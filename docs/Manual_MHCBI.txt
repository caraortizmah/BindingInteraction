The MHC BindingInteraction pipeline Manual
After performing all steps in the installing instructions you can run the pipeline over a new project.

$ ./pre-run.sh
You have to complete all steps in order. First step is aimed to set some paths prior to run a new project:

Notepadding: A new project is a work performed by MHCBI pipeline passing through the three stages: optimizations, mutations and calculations. All folders, inputs and outputs created during the whole process are the new project. Each individual PDB structure has one new project.

PDB structure path is the directory where is placed the new project PDB structure.

PDB structure name is the PDB structure (located in the previous path). A PDB format can have several valid formats, however in this MHCBI pipeline, format has the following guideline:

   1.  PDB structures having a receptor-ligand MHC-like

Receptor has to be named as chain A and B and ligand as chain P. In case of having crystallographic water molecules, all of them must be named as chain V.

   2.  PDB structures having a 12-column features

In test folder there are two examples (shortened 1BX2 and 3OXS) having 12-column features as it should be used for every PDB structure in any project. In the PDB structure for a new project remove all information not related with 3D atomic coordinates.

   3.  PDB structures name

PDB structure names have to be named only with alpha-numeric characters and without any blank space. Remove any special character (#$/!@'´{}}}}), even any kind of hyphen (-_), or punctuation (.,:;) in your PDB structure name.

to-do work path is the directory where you want to place the new project.

name of your work is the name of your new project.

 

Setup and pre-run scripts create .log files having all required paths. You can modify them without using the pipeline, but you can not change any word related to the format. It is advisable to use the pipeline for setting paths.

In pre-run script, Second step configures pipeline core in all of the new folders that will be the new project. If the MHCBI can not detect one of the required paths, configuration step will not be performed.

After configuring the new project you can run the pipeline. Third step presents two options for running MHCBI over a PDB structure:

   1.  Performing the three-stage methodology in a single step.

   2.  Performing the three-stage methodology step by step.

 

To sum up:

  Step	                 Instruction	                                 Command
____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
   1	            Set work and PDB directories               	    ./pre-run.sh (option 1)

   2	     Configure folders and scripts for the new project	    ./pre-run.sh (option 2)

   3	                Run the MHCBI pipeline	                    ./pre-run.sh (option 3)

Warnings!

Some Open Babel operations generate messages that could be frightening, however those messages are atoms (ATOM) in PDB format named as HETATM by Dowser operations, do not worry about it.

When Dowser puts waters, some conversions by OpenBabel generates some warnings that look like:

=============================
*** Open Babel Warning in parseAtomRecord
WARNING: Problems reading a PDB file
Problems reading a HETATM or ATOM record.
According to the PDB specification,
columns 77-78 should contain the element symbol of an atom.
but OpenBabel found ' ' (atom 3)
==============================


In case of not finding waters by Dowser, messages like this could appear:

PDB file '/home/work_path/work_name/../dowser/1_iter/placed_waters_1.pdb' contains no atoms.
PDB file '/home/work_path/work_name/../dowser/1_iter/placed_waters_2.pdb' contains no atoms.
PDB file '/home/work_path/work_name/../dowser/1_iter/placed_waters_3.pdb' contains no atoms.
1 molecule converted


The following message could appear due to a non-existent binary path related to another process in vmd:

rlwrap: Command not found.


That message do not affect the MHCBI performance.
