The MHC BindingInteraction pipeline Manual
After performing all steps in the installing instructions you can run the pipeline over a new proyect.

$ ./pre-run.sh
You have to complete all steps in order. First step is aimed to set some paths prior to run a new proyect:

Notepadding: A new proyect is a work performed by MHCBI pipeline passing through the three stages: optimizations, mutations and calculations. All folders, inputs and outputs created during the whole process are the new proyect. Each individual PDB structure has one new proyect.

PDB structure path is the directory where is placed the new proyect PDB structure.

PDB structure name is the PDB structure (located in the previous path). A PDB format can have several valid formats, however in this MHCBI pipeline, format has the following guideline:

   1.  PDB structures having a receptor-ligand MHC-like

Receptor has to be named as chain A and B and ligand as chain P. In case of having crystallographic water molecules, all of them must be named as chain V.

   2.  PDB structures having a 12-column features

In test folder there are two examples (shortened 1BX2 and 3OXS) having 12-column features as it should be used for every PDB structure in any proyect. In the PDB structure for a new proyect remove all information not related with 3D atomic coordinates.

to-do work path is the directory where you want to place the new proyect.

name of your work is the name of your new proyect.

 

Setup and pre-run scripts create .log files having all required paths. You can modify them without using the pipeline, but you can not change any word related to the format. It is advisable to use the pipeline for setting paths.

In pre-run script, Second step configures pipeline core in all of the new folders that will be the new proyect. If the MHCBI can not detect one of the required paths, configuration step will not be performed.

After configuring the new proyect you can run the pipeline. Third step presents two options for running MHCBI over a PDB structure:

   1.  Performing the three-stage methodology in a single step.

   2.  Performing the three-stage methodology step by step.
