# MHCBI docs

`MHCBI Documentation` are divided in three sections, each one having .txt and .html format. The three sections are:

     1. Requirements
     2. Installation
     3. Manual
    
## Requirements

Requirements.txt and Requirements.html contain information about how to install or get more information about installation process for any required program 
prior to configure and install the `MHCBI` pipeline. This section is the first to be read and performed.

## Installation

Install_documentation.txt and Install_documentation.html have further information about configuring and installing process 
(only a brief information is in the main README.md). This section must be read and achieved after reading and performing completely the first section.

## Manual

Named as Manual_MHCBI.txt and Manual_MHCBI.html, these files have information related to the technical `MHCBI` operation such as input formats, 
work folder placement, stage explanations, key role for main folders, outputs formats and placement among others. Understanding all these aspects
could be substantial for a better `MHCBI` handling.
