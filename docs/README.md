# MHCBI docs

`MHCBI documentation` is divided into three sections, each one having .txt and .html format. The three sections are:

     1. Requirements
     2. Installation
     3. Manual
    
## Requirements

Requirements.txt and Requirements.html contain information about how to install or get more information about installation for any required program 
prior to configuring and installing the `MHCBI` pipeline. This section must be read first.

## Installation

Install_documentation.txt and Install_documentation.html which provide further information about configuring and installing `MHCBI` 
(only brief information is in the main README.md). This section must be read and followed after reading it and completing the first section in its entirety.

## Manual

Called Manual_MHCBI.txt and Manual_MHCBI.html, these files have information related to technical aspects of `MHCBI` operation, such as input formats, 
work folder placement, stage explanations, key role for main folders, output formats and placements. Understanding all these aspects
should ensure better `MHCBI` handling.
