About the MHC Binding Interaction pipeline:

The MHC Binding Interaction (MHCBI) is a pipeline software that manages and uses other programmes to perform some tasks related to calculating protein peptide receptor-ligand binding energy in the field of computational chemistry. The MHCBI has been used with receptor-ligand complexes, such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. It can therefore be extrapolated to other non-covalent interaction systems (i.e. MHC-like structures).


Applications related to using the MHCBI pipeline can be found in the following work:

Ortiz-Mahecha, Carlos A., Bohórquez, Hugo J., Agudelo, William A., Patarroyo, Manuel A., Patarroyo, Manuel E. and Suárez, Carlos F. "Assessing peptide binding to MHC II: An accurate semi-empirical quantum mechanics-based proposal." Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, (2019). - DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00672


Program Documentation
 

After typing 

   $  git clone https://github.com/caraortizmah/bindinginteraction.git

you can modify the MHCBI pipeline to create your own version. For installing (at your current location) type:

   $  cd BindingInteraction

The MHCBI pipeline has four folders such as BindingInteraction, docs, source, test. 

The BindingInteraction folder contains essential scripts for installing and configuring the pipeline. The Installation stage relies on this folder.
The docs folder contains further information regarding installation and a brief manual for users.
The source folder contains all the scripts involved in MHCBI performance for every user project. This folder is at core of the MHCBI pipeline.
The test folder contains two PDB structure examples: short (MHC class II) and straight (MHC class I) which a user has to use to test the pipeline.
Short test consists of a shortened HLA-DR2 molecule complexed with a human myelin basic protein peptide (the original PDB structure is known as 1BX2 in the protein data bank). Straight test consists of HLA A*02:07 complexed with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) core 18-27 peptide (the original PDB structure is known as 3OXS in the protein data bank).

After typing

   $  chmod +x init.sh
   $  ./init.sh
   
the MHCBI asks about location when you are going to install the pipeline. If answering yes, your location will be the same as the git location, otherwise (answering no) you have to provide a new location for installing it.

You must install the following programmes before configuring the pipeline:
   
   Linux text processing tools:

 + grep
 + cut
 + awk
 + gawk
 + sed
 + vim
 
     Specialized software:

 + Open Babel
 + VMD - Visual Molecular Dynamics
 + Dowser
 + MOPAC - Molecular Orbital PACkage (MOPAC2016)
 + UCSF Chimera
 + PROPKA 3.1
 + Python 2.7 or higher
 
    (Optional)

 + GAMESS - General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System
 + Wine
 + Facio (FMO software)
 
Once all the requirements have been installed and placed in the pre-installed pipeline location, type: 

   $  ./setup.sh
   
You must complete all steps in order.

The first step requires you to provide the MHCBI with absolute path names for specialized programs (external program paths).
The second consists of testing the MHCBI pipeline; be aware of the proper functioning of every absolute path.

                                                                        cd 'git_MHCBI_path'
    2	       Initialize the MHCBI pipeline                               chmod +x init.sh
                                                                            ./init.sh

    3	           Configure the MHCBI 	                              cd 'to-install_MHCBI_path'
                                                                       ./setup.sh (option 1)

    4	             Test the MHCBI	                                ./setup.sh (option 2)
