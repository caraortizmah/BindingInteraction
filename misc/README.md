# MHCBI DFTB3 parameters

You must have third order parameters (for organic and biological systems - 3OB) for making calculations under FMO framework in GAMESS using the DFTB3 method. You can get further information about parameters using the following [link](https://dftb.org/parameters/download/3ob/3ob-3-1-cc) and download them also if you want.

These parameters are contained in the `MHCBI` pipeline's `misc` folder. You do need not to do anything else, the pipeline will place the `misc` folder where it is needed.
