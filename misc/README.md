# MHCBI DFTB3 parameters

It is mandatory to have the third order parameters (for organic and biological systems - 3OB) for performing calculations under FMO framework in GAMESS using DFTB3 method. You can get further information about parameters in the following [link](https://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Installation/install.html) and download them also if you want.

`MHCBI` pipeline has those paramteres in `misc` folder. You do not need to do anything else. The pipeline will place `misc` folder where it needs.
