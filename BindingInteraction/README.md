# MHCBI BindingInteraction

In this folder is placed the main scripts. These scripts are managers for all scripts in `source` folder. These scripts initialize, configure, test and run the `MHCBI` pipeline.
If you are user developer and you already initialize `MHCBI` pipeline, you have to execute ./clean.sh in the main folder where you download the pipeline (downloaded by your own or using git clone). clean.sh places scripts as the initial pipeline conditions.
After that you can do a pull request if you have considerable and important changes for improving the pipeline.
