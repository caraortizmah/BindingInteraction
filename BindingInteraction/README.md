# The MHCBI BindingInteraction

This folder contains the main scripts. These are the managers for all scripts in the `source` folder. These scripts initialize, configure, test and run the `MHCBI` pipeline.

## Notepadding

First, ensure that you have read all documentation available in the `docs` folder prior to reading this specific information.

## Advanced options

If you are a user developer and you have already initialize the `MHCBI` pipeline, you must execute ./clean.sh in the `git path` where you downloaded the pipeline (downloaded by yourself or using the git clone command); clean.sh places scripts as the initial pipeline configuration.

Execute ./clean.sh prior to making a pull request.
You can make a pull request if you consider that your source code changes are important and might improve the pipeline.
